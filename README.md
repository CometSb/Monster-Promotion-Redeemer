# MonsterPromotionRedeemer
This is a little fast project i made for my gf because she drinks monster and wanted free codes lmao.




Below are the instructions.

To get started you need an account on the monster website. 
https://musicapp.monsterenergyloyalty.com

register for an account there, Once on your redeem page open devloper console and go to the network tab.

try to redeem a code (10 charicters uppercase). you will see a request called claim. Open the request and the tokens are in the request headders.
Just copy and paste its that simple.

This method does work i got a few codes so far but its SLOW so if you want to fork or make your own version using this code dont be a skid. 
dont sell this.
